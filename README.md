Chad Meyer - Mindex Data &amp; Analytics Code Challenge

Although it was probably unnecessary to do so given the privacy and brevity of this challenge, I believe it is good practice to store credentials in a separate location over having it embedded in the code. This gives us a few advantages:
    1. Easier for future users/developers to locate and edit credentials with their own settings (or changing host or database names) and quickly run/check results
    2. Makes the rest of the code more readable for future users/developers that will update the repo. 
        I.e. no long strings, use of variable names in some methods
    3. It is generally bad practice to embed credentials (usernames, passwords, etc) in the code for
        privacy/security reasons
